<h3>AJAX API TV MAZE</h3>
<p>
I was able to partially complete, I mean it does what is requested but with some bugs. 
Bug 1 will repost list of episodes. I believe I would need to clear out the UL at some point maybe at the start of a new show search.
Bug 2 there is no protection or testing / try catch for if no image exists or if a "show" doesn't exist.

I would need a lot more time to play around with this and maybe after using some other API's will become more clear.
